## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Database already exists" error**
   - Solution: Use existing Firestore database, don't create new ones
   - Check: `firebase use <correct-project-id>`

2. **Authentication errors**
   - Solution: Ensure Firebase Auth is enabled in console
   - Check: Firestore rules are deployed

3. **Functions not deploying**
   - Solution: Check Node.js version (requires 18+)
   - Check: All dependencies installed in functions folder

4. **Gemini API errors**
   - Solution: App uses deterministic fallback plans
   - Check: API key is optional, app works without it

### Emergency Fallbacks
- If hosting fails: Use `firebase serve` for local demo
- If functions fail: Use emulator suite
- If AI fails: App automatically uses deterministic plans

## ðŸ“± Demo Environment Setup

### For Live Demo
1. Use incognito/private browser window
2. Have backup demo account ready
3. Test all flows 5 minutes before presentation
4. Have mobile device ready for responsive demo

### For Video Submission
1. Record in 1080p resolution
2. Show clear UI interactions
3. Include voiceover explaining features
